  "upload_type": "software",
  "description": "KAS-XMSS is a deterministic, hash-based post-quantum digital signature framework developed by the Kapodistrian Academy of Science. Built upon the XMSS standard (RFC 8391), KAS-XMSS provides sovereign, reproducible signature generation and verification for post-quantum use cases. It supports applications in national research infrastructure, secure long-term archives, and hybrid integration with QD-RSA.\n\nIncludes: Python and C reference implementations, test vectors, whitepaper, and automated entropy tools.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Signature Layer Independence: No reliance on NIST or external authorities. Fully auditable entropy generation and deterministic reproducibility ensure cryptographic sovereignty.",
